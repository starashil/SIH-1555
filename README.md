## Name: STAR ASHIL S
## Problem Title
SIH 1555: Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
## Problem Description
Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

## Idea

1. Immersive 3D Biome Explorer
A virtual walkthrough of different ecosystems like rainforests or mountains. Users can explore and click on plants in their natural habitat to view interactive 3D models and hear ambient sounds for a realistic experience.

2. AI Plant Doctor & Identifier
An AI tool where users can type symptoms (e.g., "cough") or upload a plant photo. The AI identifies the plant and suggests relevant AYUSH remedies, providing instant, personalized herbal guidance.

3. Personalized "MyGarden" Tracker
A personal space for users to bookmark favorite plants and log herbs they are growing. It sends custom care reminders for watering or harvesting based on their local climate and the plants they track.

4. Gamified Learning Modules
Interactive quizzes and courses on medicinal plants. Users earn badges and sharable certificates upon completing modules, making education engaging and rewarding for students and enthusiasts.

5. Practitioner's Formulation Lab
A advanced tool for students and practitioners to explore AYUSH science. It features a digital "recipe builder" for traditional formulations and a community forum to share knowledge and custom tours.
